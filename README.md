**Virtual Try-On Prototype for Myntra Hackathon**
This repository contains a virtual try-on prototype developed for the Myntra Hackathon. The prototype demonstrates how to overlay a t-shirt image onto a user's photo using pose estimation and image processing techniques.

*Features*
Pose Estimation: Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model for keypoint detection on both user and t-shirt images.
Image Processing: Resizes and overlays the t-shirt image based on shoulder keypoints detected from the user image.

*Requirements*
Python 3.6+
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
